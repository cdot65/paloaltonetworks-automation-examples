## Overview

Our Terraform project aims to manage the configuration of PAN-OS devices like firewalls and Panorama. It includes setting up ethernet interfaces, virtual routers, security zones, service objects, NAT policies, and security policies. ðŸŽ¯

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- Terraform (version 1.20+) ðŸ”§

## Setup

### Creating a Terraform Environment

To create a Terraform environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file and provide the necessary variable values (see `terraform.tfvars` for reference).

### Installing Dependencies

Install our project's dependencies:

```bash
terraform init
```

## Project Structure

Our project consists of the following Terraform files:

- `configure_panos.tf`: Contains resource definitions for configuring PAN-OS devices, including ethernet interfaces, virtual routers, security zones, service objects, NAT policies, and security policies.
- `variables.tf`: Defines input variables used in the configuration.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Provides values for the defined variables.
- `panos_provider.tf`: Configures the PAN-OS provider for Terraform.

These files work together to manage the configuration of PAN-OS devices. The `configure_panos.tf` file uses the variables defined in `variables.tf` and the values provided in `terraform.tfvars` to create the necessary resources on the PAN-OS device specified in `panos_provider.tf`.

## Execution Workflow

To execute our Terraform project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed the setup steps mentioned above.
2. Run the following command to preview the changes:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

3. If the plan looks good, apply the changes:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

4. Confirm the execution by typing `yes` when prompted.

### Screenshots
