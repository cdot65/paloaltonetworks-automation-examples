## Overview

Our container image project aims to automate the creation of an Execution Environment for interacting with PAN-OS. By leveraging the powerful CLI commands from Podman, we can streamline the process and ensure consistent and reproducible results across multiple environments. ðŸŽ¯

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- Podman installed

## Setup

### Installing Podman

- Installing Podman on [Linux, macOS, or Windows](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads)

### Installing Ansible-Builder

#### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

To create a Python virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

#### Installing Ansible Builder

With the virtual environment activated, install Ansible Builder using pip:

```bash
pip install ansible-builder
```

## Container Image File Structure

Our container image (`Dockerfile`) is dynamically built based on the contents within the `execution-environment.yml` file:

```yaml
---
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: quay.io/fedora/fedora:latest

dependencies:
  ansible_core:
    package_pip: ansible-core
  ansible_runner:
    package_pip: ansible-runner
  system:
    - openssh-clients
    - sshpass
  python:
    - xmltodict
  galaxy: requirements.yml

additional_build_steps:

  append_final:
    - RUN python3 -m pip install https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-python/archive/refs/tags/v1.11.0.tar.gz

```

### Galaxy Requirements

```yaml
collections:
  - name: paloaltonetworks.panos
    type: galaxy
    version: 2.17.0
  - name: community.general
    type: galaxy
    version: 8.0.2
```

## Execution Workflow

To execute our container image build, follow these steps:

### Using the CLI

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to build the container image with a tag:

   ```bash
   ansible-builder build --tag ghcr.io/cdot65/execution-environment-paloaltonetworks:latest
   ```

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showcasing the execution:
