## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Volume**: Organizations generate thousands of AI interactions daily with no efficient way to scan them for security threats
2. **Manual Review**: Current processes require manual review of AI outputs, which is time-consuming and error-prone
3. **Compliance Risk**: No systematic way to ensure AI outputs comply with security and content policies
4. **Threat Detection**: Difficulty in identifying prompt injection, data leakage, and other AI-specific threats at scale

### Target Users

- **Security Teams**: Need to audit AI interactions for threats
- **Compliance Officers**: Require tools to ensure AI outputs meet standards
- **DevOps Engineers**: Want to integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines
