## Overview

Our Python project aims to automate the configuration and deployment of a search tool for address objects in a Palo Alto Networks firewall configuration. By leveraging Python's powerful automation capabilities, we can streamline the process and ensure consistent and reproducible results across multiple environments. üéØ

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- Python (version 3.11+) üêç
- pip (Python package manager) üì¶

## Setup

### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

To create a Python virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Python Packages

To install the required Python packages within our virtual environment, execute:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Script Structure

Our Python script (`pan-os-object-search.py`) is structured as follows:

```python
"""Search for instances of address objects.

This script will locate all instances of an AddressObject within
the firewall's configuration.

```

The script is designed to:
1. Load environment variables for Panorama credentials.
2. Retrieve configuration objects from Panorama.
3. Search for a specified address object and its associations.
4. Present the results in a tabulated format using `tabulate`.

## Execution Workflow

To execute our Python script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python pan-os-object-search.py --prefix [your-search-prefix]
   ```

For example:
```bash
python pan-os-object-search.py --prefix 192.168.1.1
```

### Screenshots
